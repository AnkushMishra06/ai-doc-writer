# Documentation Standards

## Purpose
This document defines the expected structure, style, and content of documentation generated by the AI-powered documentation writer. It serves as the reference specification for generation, evaluation, and error analysis.

## Reference
The documentation generated by this system is based on the following industry standards:
- PEP-257 - Docstring Conventions
- Google Python Style Guide (Docstring section)

These standards are used to define correctness and consistency in generated documentation.

## Documentation Scope
The system generates documentation for:
- Python functions
- Python classes
- Public methods

Private methods and internal helper functions are excluded unless explicitly specified.

## Required Docstring Structure
Each generated docstring must contain the following sections in order:
1. Short Summary
2. Parameters
3. Returns (if applicable)
4. Additional Notes (optional)

Missing required sections are treated as documentation errors.

### Short Summary
- Must be a single concise sentence
- Written in imperative mood
- Should describe what the function does, not how it is implemented

Example:
"Compute the cosine similarity between two vectors."

### Parameters
- All parameters in the function signature must be documented
- Parameter names must exactly match the function signature
- Each parameter must include:
  - Name
  - Type (if inferable)
  - Description

Missing or hallucinated parameters are considered critical errors.

### Returns
- Must be present if the function returns a value
- Should describe:
  - Return type (if inferable)
  - Meaning of the returned value

Functions with no return value should explicitly state that they return None.

### Optional Sections
- Notes
- Raises (exceptions)
- Examples

Optional sections should only be included if information is available from the source code.

## Style and Tone Guidelines
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid redundancy
- Avoid speculative or uncertain statements
- Do not include implementation details unless necessary
- Do not use conversational language

## Hallucination Constraints
The system must not:
- Introduce parameters not present in the function signature
- Assume return values not explicitly defined
- Invent side effects or behaviors

When information is unavailable, the system should omit the section rather than hallucinate.

## Evaluation Alignment
Generated documentation is evaluated against this specification using:
- Structural completeness (presence of required sections)
- Content accuracy (alignment with source code)
- Similarity to human-written documentation

Violations of this specification are logged during error analysis.

## Versioning
This specification may evolve as the system improves. All evaluation results are associated with the version of this document active at the time of generation.
